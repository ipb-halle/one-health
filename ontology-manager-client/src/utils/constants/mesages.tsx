At the moment, this tool is still primarily focused on the analysis of data of Cuban plants. Hence, the output for plants from other geographical regions might be weaker. <br/>
This tool shows connections of available data which could be <b>erroneous</b>, <b>biased</b>  and <b>not necessarily the most relevant</b> one for your scientific question  <br/> since  it  was <b>extracted from available data sources with an automatic process</b>. 
<br/> We are actively working to expand the data basis (please contribute!) and improve the data quality of the platform.
